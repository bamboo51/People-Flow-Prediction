## Null Hypothesis

In scientific research, the null hypothesis (often denoted $H_{0}$) is the claim that the effect being studied does not exist. Note that the term "effect" here is not meant to imply a causative relationship.

The null hypothesis can also be described as the hypothesis in which no relationship exists between two sets of data or variables being analyzed. If the null hypothesis is true, any experimentally observed effect is due to chance alone, hence the term "null". In contrast with the null hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis is developed, which claims that a relationship does exist between two variables.

## p-value
* A p-value is a statistical measurement used to validate a hypothesis against observed data.
* A p-value measures the probability of obtaining the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
* The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference.
* A p-value of 0.05 or lower is generally considered statistically significant.
